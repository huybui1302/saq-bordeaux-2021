A script that scrapes the SAQ My Bordeaux Future 2021 page and the Tastingbook Bordeaux 2021 page to create a personalized collection based on price and review score

I wrote this script to address the lack of a sort function on the SAQ My Bordeaux Future 2021 website based on price and the lack of available reviews. While browsing the web for reviews, I stumbled upon tastingbook.com, which has a quite comprehensive list of reviews on Bordeaux wines of 2021.

I then came up with the idea of scraping both websites and combining the information available to create a personalized collection of 2021 Bordeaux based on a price floor, price ceiling, and review cut-off score.

This allowed me to narrow down the collection of 140 wines available on the SAQ website to 6 that were within my price range and desired review score :)

Although the pre-order window had been closed as of July 03, 2022, I hope this script could be of help to those who seek to purchase unreviewed Bordeaux from SAQ in the future. This script is functional, but not perfect, so clone and alter at will :)
